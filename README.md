## Architecture	🏢
This project use a combination of [Multi-module architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/modularization) and [(Model-View Model-Model](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture#recommended-app-arch), explain as clean architecture for Android Developement.
A very well-made example by Android can be found [Now in Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid)
